A simple Javascript game of Rock Paper Scissors

This game is my first Javascript project, created so that the player can play a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors against a computer
and view the results in the Console. Through developing this project I've learned:
1) The importance of debugging using console.log() and analyzing Console Error messages.
2) How to create javascript functions, creating functions to:
  - randomly generate an integer of 0, 1, or 2
  - have the computer play a round of rock, paper, scissors using randomly generated integers
  - have the player play a round of rock, paper, scissors against the computer
  - have the these rounds occur with five player prompts in a row, keeping track of results and displaying a winner
3) How to create for loops to run the game 5 times in a row
4) How to create else if conditionals to display the winner of the 5 rounds
5) How to create switch statements to determine what the computer will play based off of a random integer
  - How to create nested switch statements in order to have each round compare 3 cases of playerSelections with 
    their own switch statements to display and keep track of results based off of 3 possible computerSelections
